# Overview
Accurate characterization of in-utero brain development is essential for understanding typical and atypical neurodevelopment. Building upon previous efforts to construct spatiotemporal fetal brain MRI atlases, we present the CRL-2025 fetal brain atlas, which is a spatiotemporal (4D) atlas of the developing fetal brain between 21 and 37 gestational weeks. This atlas is constructed from carefully processed MRI scans of 160 healthy fetuses using a temporally consistent diffeomorphic registration framework integrated with kernel regression in age. CRL-2025 uniquely includes detailed tissue segmentations, transient white matter compartments, and parcellation into 124 anatomical regions. This atlas offers significantly enhanced anatomical details over the CRL-2017 atlas, and is released along with the CRL diffusion MRI atlas with its newly created tissue segmentation and labels as well as deep-learning based multiclass segmentation models for fine-grained fetal brain MRI segmentation. The CRL-2025 atlas and its associated tools provide a robust and scalable platform for fetal brain MRI segmentation, groupwise analysis, and early neurodevelopmental research, and are publicly released to support the broader research community.
